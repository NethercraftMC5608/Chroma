# Chroma
Chroma is a "frontend" (whatever you call it) of the existing Google Chromecast.


Chroma recreates the experience of Google TV, a platform only working on newer 4th gen chromecasts.

Chroma uses [pychromecast](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/pychromecast) the base of Chroma.

**Unfinished Instructions:**
To connect your Chromecast to Chroma, you'd first need to run the application.
Very scary stuff, once you get the application executed, it would give you a one time setup wizardry.
it will ask for the good name of the chromecast, which would be your chromecast set name. "Living Room TV"
once you've done that, your pretty much set to be running Chroma on your older generation Google Chromecast.

*shitty code shitty interface what else do you want?*
